With a solid foundation in music and a clear passion for storytelling through song, Mr. Lim&#x27;s journey reflects an unwavering dedication to his craft and a promising future in the operatic realm.

A native of South Korea, Mr. Lim began his musical journey at the University of Seoul, earning his Bachelor of Music degree. He further honed his skills and deepened his artistry by completing a Master of Music degree under the guidance and support of soprano Shigemi Matsumoto at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), where he emerged as one of the top talents in their celebrated opera program.

His academic excellence was recognized with the “Best Student in Opera” award at CSUN, a testament to his exceptional contributions to the field. He continues to refine his artistry and technique at the University of Southern California (USC), working closely with renowned baritone Derrick Lawrence.



Dominic Lim has demonstrated remarkable versatility on stage, seamlessly transitioning between comedic and dramatic roles. While at CSUN, his portrayal of iconic characters highlighted both his vocal and dramatic prowess.

His characters, ‘Lucas’ in L&#x27;Ivrogne Corrigé by Gluck and ‘Coline’ in Puccini&#x27;s La Bohème revealed his skill in both baroque and romantic repertoire, while his work as ‘Sprecher’ in Die Zauberflöte showcased his authoritative and resonant vocal delivery. These roles, coupled with his collaborations as a bass soloist in Mozart&#x27;s Requiem, Fauré&#x27;s Requiem, and Handel&#x27;s Messiah, have demonstrated Mr. Lim&#x27;s technical mastery and interpretative depth.



Outside the academic setting, Mr. Lim continues to thrive as a sought-after performer with professional opera companies and festivals. He brought depth and nuance to the role of ‘Frère Laurent’ in Gounod&#x27;s Roméo et Juliette and portrayed ‘Yamadori’ and ‘il Commissario’ in Puccini&#x27;s Madama Butterfly with Mission Opera. With Landmark Opera, his comedic timing and vocal precision shone as ‘Maestro Spinelloccio’ and ‘Amantio di Nicolao’ in Puccini&#x27;s Gianni Schicchi.

In 2024, Mr. Lim&#x27;s portrayal of ‘Leporello’ in Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni at the Varna International Music Academy (VIMA) in South Carolina, under the baton of Metropolitan Opera conductor Gregory Buchalter, marked a significant milestone in his career. This role not only highlighted his flair for dramatic interpretation but also solidified his growing reputation as an exceptional performer on the international stage.

In 2025, Mr. Lim served as the choral section leader in ‘Three Women in Jerusalem (Las tres mujeres de Jerusalén)’ with LA Opera and took on principal roles in ‘Le nozze di Figaro’ with the Santa Monica College Opera Theater as a community artist. Notably, he performed both leading roles - Figaro and the Count - in ‘Le nozze di Figaro’, delivering compelling portrayals in each and earning acclaim for his musical depth and dramatic versatility.



Dominic Lim&#x27;s accomplishments extend beyond the stage. He has received accolades such as a Certificate of Recognition from the California Assembly for his dedication to the Korean community and was selected as a performer in the prestigious SMC Aria Competition.
